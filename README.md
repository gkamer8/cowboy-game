# Solving a Common Schoolyard Game

This repo contains a solution I wrote for the "cowboy game" (alternatively: "load, shield, shoot"; "007"). There is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium that can be approximately solved after specifying a large nonlinear equation.

You can find a write-up in [Cowboy.pdf](/Cowboy.pdf).
